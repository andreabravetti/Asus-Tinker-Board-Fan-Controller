The hardware schematic can be found in the root in pdf and DipTrace format.

The case-cutout folder contains drawings, CamBam cad files and gcode files for a fan cutout in a WD PiDrive enclosure.

The fan-controller folder contains the source code for a fan controller program using the Tinker Board PWM output on the GPIO port.
